User-visible changes between 2.7.1 and 2.7.2 include:

User-visible changes between 2.6 and 2.7.1 include:

 - fix a warning regarding the redefinition of NNOTES

 - raise NNOTES from 127 to 128 (only notes 0..125 were being shown
 because 127 was < NNOTES and 126 is black)

 - only show the keys that exist on a real piano by default, and add a
 "-f" ('full midi keyboard') command line option to show all midi
 notes.

 - make the dimensions slightly closer to a real piano by:
   > making the black key hight two third of the white key height
   > making the black key positions vary based on their position in
     the octave

 - adding a QWERTY_REV layout that has the lower keys on the upper row
 of the keyboard

 - adding QWERTY_UK and QWERTY_UK_REV layouts that extend the QWERTY
 and QWERTY_REV layouts with the punctuation keys available on those
 rows

User-visible changes between 2.5 and 2.6 include:

 - Bugfix: A key volume of zero means key off.
 - Bugfix: Make pianola/OMNI mode the default.
 - Feature: Don't start jackd when starting jack-keyboard.

User-visible changes between 2.4 and 2.5 include:

 - Autotools.  This should make life easier for distributors.  ;-)

User-visible changes between 2.3 and 2.4 include:

 - Keyboard layout switching.  Now you can specify "-l QWERTZ"
   or "-l AZERTY" and keyboard layout will be (hopefully) usable.

 - Implement output rate limiting; specifying "-r 31.25" in a command
   line will limit jack-keyboard to the rate mandated by the MIDI
   specification.

 - Remove the "-n" option; not connecting to the MIDI port at startup
   is the default behaviour.

 - Start jackd automatically, even when not compiled against LASH.

 - Fix "make install" on systems without /usr/local/share/icons/hicolor.

User-visible changes between 2.2 and 2.3 include:

 - Fix "make install" on systems without /usr/local/bin.

 - Fix crash with jackdmp, reported and tested by Juuso Alasuutari.

 - Make it possible to switch between windows using Alt-Tab
   when the keyboard is grabbed.

User-visible changes between 2.1 and 2.2 include:

 - Add 4 to "Octave".  What that means is, C4 is in octave #4,
   not #0.

 - Icon ;-)

 - Documentation updates.

User-visible changes between 2.0 and 2.1 include:

 - It's possible to change "high" and "low" velocity.  To change
   the former, press and hold Shift key and move slider.  To change
   the latter, do the same with Ctrl key.

   Moving the slider without Ctrl or Shift held changes "normal"
   velocity.

 - Fix ugly memory corruption that could cause strange behaviour
   (including crashes) in pianola mode.

User-visible changes between 1.8 and 2.0 include:

 - GUI; now jack-keyboard should be more intuitive.  It can be turned
   off using -G option.

 - Support keyboard grabbing - with the -K option, jack-keyboard
   will get all the keyboard input, even when it does not have focus.
   In other words, you can play while mousing in different program
   (synth, for example) at the same time.

   Note that this will not work if another application grabs
   the keyboard.
 
 - LASH support.

 - Install ".desktop" file.

Changes between 1.7 and 1.8:

 - Fix compilation with SVN version of JACK.

Changes between 1.6 and 1.7:

 - Add "keyboard cue" to show you which part of virtual keyboard your
   PC keyboard keys are currently mapped to.  It looks a little ugly,
   so it's disabled by default; you can enable it using "-C" option.

 - Add an "-u" option to automatically send bank/program change messages
   after reconnecting

 - Warn when bank/program shown in title bar could be different than the
   one used by the synth

 - Fix setting bank/program from the command line

Changes between 1.5 and 1.6:

 - Send messages with proper time offsets.  If you don't like this,
   you can make jack-keyboard behave same as before by using -t option

 - Implement MIDI channel switching (submitted by Nedko Arnaudov)

 - Make it possible to enter bank/program number directly using keypad

 - Make bank switching actually work
 
 - Don't crash when clicking _and_ releasing mouse button on the gray area

Changes between 1.4 and 1.5:

 - Add "pianola mode" - jack-keyboard now has a MIDI input port; events received
   on this port will change the visible state of keyboard - basically, you will
   see the notes played.  Note that, by default, jack-keyboard will refuse to
   connect to other clients named 'jack-keyboard'; this is to prevent loops.

 - Make panic key more reliable

 - Numeric keys (top row on the alphanumeric keyboard) pressed with Shift held
   should work correctly now

 - Threading fixes - if jack-keyboard behaved in unpredictable way, it should
   be fixed now

 - Add manual page

 - Add 'install' Makefile target ;-)

Changes between 1.3 and 1.4:

 - Don't stop the notes when moving mouse outside of the window (suggested by ctaf @ #lad)

 - Show some useful information in the window title

 - Rewrite MIDI input switching to make it more robust

 - Remove the command line MIDI port selection.  Just use Insert/Delete keys to cycle to the
   port you need

 - Don't refuse to start when there are no MIDI input ports to connect to (suggested by Nedko Arnaudov)

Changes between 1.2 and 1.3:

 - Use the ringbuffer instead of old 'table of notes'.  Now the notes won't
   get lost even under high CPU load

 - Add 'panic key', under 'Esc' key, that stops all sounds

 - Add Bank Change (Home/End)

Changes between 1.1 and 1.2:

 - Make it possible to run several instances of jack-keyboard at the same time

 - Add the ability to switch MIDI inputs at runtime (Insert/Delete keys)

 - Warn about JACK timing problems

 - Minor display optimization

 - Fix crash after pressing highest (#127) note

Changes between 1.0 and 1.1:

 - Speed up redrawing

 - Add MIDI port selection ("jack-keyboard 3" will connect to fourth available
   JACK MIDI input port)

 - Fix sustain key (space)
